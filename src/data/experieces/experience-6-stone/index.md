Currently I'm working at Stone in their Banking team, implementing new features not only for our direct banking customers, but also for our partners through our public API.

At Stone I got to learn Elixir through an awesome [training program](https://medium.com/stonetech/tudo-sobre-o-primeiro-programa-de-forma%C3%A7%C3%A3o-da-stone-3d230a309350) and I feel like I'm really blossoming as a developer. I'm also learning a lot about infrainstructure and observability.
