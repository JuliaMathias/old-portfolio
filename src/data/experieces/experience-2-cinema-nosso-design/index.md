Even though it was technically an internship, I was the only designer at this NGO, and thus did everything. From social media to tÂ­shirts, folders, posters, dvd cases, postcards, email marketing, keynotes and internal communication pieces. I often had to deal with extremely strict sponsor guidelines as well, so it taught me a lot of discipline in my design work.
