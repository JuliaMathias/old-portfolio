content: "I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be applications, blog posts, art, stories or anything in between. At work my goal is to always build products that are beautiful, put the user first and provide value. And here on this website I talk a bit about what I am learning, side-projects I'm building or whatever else comes to mind.


In December 2020, I completed a web-development bootcamp at Le Wagon and in 2021, I joined Stone as an Elixir Developer. It was a challenge since I had never studied Elixir before (at the bootcamp we mostly worked with rails) and was not familiar with functional programming but I quickly fell in love with it! It's been amazing to work on a product that is used by so many brazilian entrepreneurs."
